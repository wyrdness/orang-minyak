## Cautions and Limitations

### Source Quality Issues

- **Newspaper accounts**: Often sensationalized; verification difficult
- **Oral histories**: Memory affected by time and subsequent narratives
- **Police records**: Access restricted; incomplete documentation
- **Film portrayals**: Artistic license; not documentary sources
- **Online sources**: Highly variable quality; verification essential
- **Some academic sources**: May rely on secondary sources; check citations

### Gaps in Documentation

- **Limited victim voices**: Most sources are from police, media, researchers rather than victims themselves
- **Rural perspectives**: Urban media may miss rural experiences
- **Non-elite perspectives**: Working-class voices underrepresented
- **Women's perspectives**: Male-dominated media and scholarship may miss women's interpretations
- **Ethnic diversity**: Malay perspectives may dominate; Chinese, Indian, indigenous perspectives less documented

### Ethical Research Considerations

Researchers should:
- **Respect victim privacy**: Don't sensationalize trauma
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Recognize living cultural tradition
- **Avoid recolonization**: Don't impose Western frameworks without understanding local context
- **Verify sources**: Many secondary sources repeat unverified claims
- **Consider impact**: Research can revive panics or cause harm

---

## Conclusion

This source list provides entry points for rigorous research on the Orang Minyak phenomenon. The topic requires interdisciplinary approach drawing from:

- **Folklore and anthropology**: Understanding traditional narratives
- **Sociology**: Analyzing moral panic mechanisms
- **Psychology**: Understanding mass hysteria and suggestion
- **Criminology**: Examining real assault dimension
- **Gender studies**: Analyzing gendered violence and narratives
- **Post-colonial studies**: Contextualizing in Malaysian independence

**For researchers new to the topic, recommended starting points**:

1. **Clammer (1976)** - foundational sociological study
2. **NewspaperSG archives** - primary sources from panic periods
3. **P. Ramlee's 1968 film** - cultural artifact
4. **Cohen (1972)** - moral panic theory framework
