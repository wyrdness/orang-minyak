      "summary": "A Malaysian and Singaporean urban legend describing a naked man covered in black oil who assaults women. The phenomenon represents a complex intersection of traditional folklore, modern moral panic, actual criminal activity, and gendered anxieties about safety and modernity in post-colonial Southeast Asia.",
      "full": "The Orang Minyak (Oily Man) is a figure in Malaysian and Singaporean folklore and urban legend, typically described as a naked man covered head-to-toe in black oil or grease who breaks into homes to assault women. The legend combines elements of traditional Malay supernatural beliefs with modern urban fears, peaking as a moral panic during the 1960s-1970s. While rooted in folklore about men gaining supernatural powers through occult rituals involving oil, the phenomenon became infamous through waves of reported assaults that sparked widespread fear, police investigations, and significant social discourse about women's safety, modernity, and cultural change. The Orang Minyak represents a complex case study in how folklore intersects with real crime, mass hysteria, media amplification, and gendered violence."
